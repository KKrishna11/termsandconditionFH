    <h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Welcome to Florian Hurel Hair Couture. By using our website, you agree to
      comply with and be bound by the following terms and conditions. Please
      review the following terms carefully. If you do not agree with any of
      these terms, you should not use this website or services provided by
      FHSPL.
    </p>

    <h2>Services</h2>
    <p>
      This website is managed by M/s. Florian Hurel Salons Private Limited
      (“FHSPL”) and your use of this site is governed by the following terms and
      conditions. The site is exclusively intended for Indian nationals residing
      in India who are at least 18 years of age. Access is restricted in regions
      where local regulations prohibit it or where operating the site is
      illegal.
    </p>
    <p>
      The site enables consumers to choose products or in-salon services and
      express interest in having them delivered or redeemed. The responsibility
      for processing payments and delivering products or redeeming in-salon
      services rests solely with the salon; FHSPL takes no responsibility for
      these transactions.
    </p>

    <h2>Modifications</h2>
    <p>
      FHSPL retains the right to extend, cancel, modify, discontinue, or change
      the terms and conditions of the site at its sole discretion without prior
      notice. No correspondence regarding these modifications will be
      entertained, and FHSPL shall not be liable for any loss or damage if the
      salon needs to discontinue or cancel wishlist processing due to compliance
      or other unavoidable circumstances. Consumers will be informed of any such
      discontinuation or cancellation as soon as practicable.
    </p>

    <h2>User Responsibilities</h2>
    <p>
      By accessing this website, you agree to be responsible for maintaining the
      confidentiality of your account information and password. You accept
      responsibility for all activities that occur under your account. Any
      unauthorized use of your account or any breach of security must be
      reported to FHSPL immediately. FHSPL is not responsible for any losses
      arising from the unauthorized use of your account.
    </p>

    <h2>Prohibited Activities</h2>
    <p>
      Users are prohibited from engaging in activities that are unlawful or
      violate FHSPL's rights or other users. This includes, but is not limited
      to, fraudulent activities, uploading harmful files, and violating
      intellectual property rights. Violating these restrictions may result in
      termination of your access to the site without notice.
    </p>

    <h2>Payment and Billing</h2>

    <p>
      All payments made through the site are processed by the salon. Accepted

      are subject to the salon's policy and will be handled directly with the
      salon.
    </p>

    <h2>Payment Gateway and Security</h2>
    <p>
      We use secure third-party payment gateways to process payments for
      services and gift cards. These gateways are certified to handle sensitive
      payment information and ensure encryption of your payment data during
      transmission. We do not store your payment card details on our servers. By
      using our payment services, you agree to the terms and policies of our
      payment gateway provider. While we ensure the security of payment
      transactions, we are not liable for any unauthorized access or data
      breaches that occur outside our control.
    </p>

    <h2>Gift Card Terms</h2>
    <p>
      Gift cards purchased from our website can be redeemed for in-salon
      services or products. Gift cards are non-refundable and cannot be
      exchanged for cash. The gift card is valid for [1 (one) month] from the
      date of purchase. Any remaining balance on the gift card must be used
      before the expiration date. We are not responsible for lost or stolen gift
      cards.
    </p>

    <p>

      payment processors) or if required by law. We implement appropriate
      security measures to protect your data but cannot guarantee complete
      security of transmitted data.
